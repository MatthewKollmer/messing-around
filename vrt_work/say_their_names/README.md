Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what I've done so far:

1) Using Seguin & Rigby's lynching dataset [see here](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/2378023119841780) and [here](https://archive.ciser.cornell.edu/studies/2833/data-and-documentation), I extracted names of Black victims between 1883 and 1921, and cities where their murders occurred. If full names or cities were missing, I didn't include them in my subset of the data. This resulted in about 450 instances with victims and places named. See my [preprocessing notebook](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/messing-around/blob/main/vrt_work/say_their_names/preprocessing.ipynb) for this code.
2) I put the names, cities, and years of occurrence into a pipeline that scrapes Chronicling America search results. This scraping pipeline identifies any pages from the year of occurrence where the victim name and city appears within 100 words of each other. Then it scrapes the newspaper content of all those pages. The scraped contents were saved to separate csv files (separated by victim names). This resulted in about 350 victim clusters and a total of about 19,000 digitized pages. See my [scraping notebook](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/messing-around/blob/main/vrt_work/say_their_names/build_newspaper_dataset.ipynb) for this code.
3) Then I did a little bit of post-processing (more to be done yet). I corrected minor OCR errors (added spaces where they were missing between victim names) and created clippings of the newspapers around instances of victim names (the 100 words before and after victim names). See my [post-processing notebook](https://github.com/MatthewKollmer/messing-around/blob/main/vrt_work/say_their_names/postprocessing.ipynb) for this code.
4) Look to the lynch_clusters directory in my [Box folder](https://uofi.app.box.com/folder/283228321987?s=hhekbeupm9sgkh8nb3dbo7ial4xpioud) to find the results–about 350 .csv files titled after each victim's name, with pages where they–and the city of their murder–was named.

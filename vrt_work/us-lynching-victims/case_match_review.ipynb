    "Some of the early reports claimed the mob was deterred by the miltary. Others say it was not. The latter reports discuss the skirmish and deaths of people in the mob. Apparently there was a shootout before the lynching occurred. Some of the last reports (the ones from the following year) mention the case as a mode of comparison to other instances of racial violence. There were also some that seem to indicate the Click Mitchell case resulted in court cases against the military for failing to protect Mitchell.\n",

Holmes says it is better tobe 70 years young than 40 years old.At last the right word has been fotmdfor death by electricity. It is electricide.Admiral Porter had his 76th birthdayparty a few days ago. Gen. B. F. Butler sent regrets.There are at least thirty colleges thathad a perfectly quiet graduating andcommencement day. They were thedeaf mute schools.In all the national educational exhibitsat the Paris exposition the most prominent and interesting feature is the industrial and manual training display.They say that Woodruff, the Croninmurder confessor, has told at least onetruth in his multifarious stories. He hasadmitted that he is an indefatigable liar.Since President Harrison has been inoffice he has had one band of visitors whodid not annoy him. They were 126Dunkard brethren, recently. Not one ofthem wanted an office.The death of John Gilbert leaves yetalive only one of the famous old actorswho were contemporary with CharlotteCushman. This is James E. Murdoch,the Hamlet of a past generation. Mr.Murdoch is one year younger thanJohn Gilbert. His powers are undimmed. Mr. Murdoch is president of thePhiladelphia school of oratory.The Samoan Treaty.So we shall have to wait officially andformally till the meeting of the senatenext December before finding out theprovisions of the Samoan treaty at Berlin. The grapevine telegraph has, however, probably given a tolerably correotoutline of it. Through this source it isascertained that King Malietoa is to berestored to the throne, and will governthe islands under the joint protection ofthe United States and Germany. Shoulddifferences arise between the two protectors, England will settle them by arbi\\'-*. -fThere will be a paHiament or congress,composed of two houses, the members tobe elected b~ the Samoans themselves.This congri ihall have the right to levycustoms «luties. But the United States,England and Germany are to be boundby a tariff schedule framed at the Berlinconference. Germany is to receive indemnity for losses in the late disturbances. It is uncertain under diplomaticusage whether the Berlin document is tobe called a treaty or an agreement.Whichever it is, however, it will not gointo effect until ratified by the UnitedStates senate.An Old Fashioned Fomtfi.Let us resurrect the old fashionedFourth this year. It is the centennialyear of our existence as a nation.Forty years ago every rural neighborhood had its basket picnic on the Fourth.Baskets were packed full of homemadedelicacies drawn from the overflowingabundance of fertile farms. Fatherstook their families in the great wagonor carriage, and all hied to some greengrove, shady and sweet. Perhaps therewas a procession of the Sunday schoolchildred along the village street in themorning. At their head the neighborhood brass band played \"Yankee Doodle\" or the \"Star Spangled Banner,\" andeach father and mother thought theirchildren marched better than any others.At the grove the procession disbanded.The most popular preacher thereaboutsprayed eloquently that the blessing ofheaven might be upon thi3 country forever and forever, as it had been with thefathers in times past Then there waspatriotic singing by the church choir orthe home glee club. Then the man withthe best voice read the glorious oldDeclaration of Independence to his neighbors and friends. Every year this wasdone. It was done in order to familiarize the children with this immortal document. So it was thought the love of liberty, sacred and splendid, would be kindled in their young breasts and glowduring their lives. It was boys broughtup on the old fashioned Fourth of Julywho fought the battles of 1861. Whyare not the children now taught moreabout the Declaration of Independence?Sometimes there was an oration. Perhaps there were several speeches andmore flinging. Then the formal ceremonies were over. Fathers, mothers,children and friends threw care to thewinds the rest of the day and enjoyed along, restful afternoon in, the woods.Who gets any rest on the Fourth of Jqlynow?We have changed everything. In cities the Fourth is a chapter from inferno.The rising generation have nothing to do.but explode gunpowder, and they do itBoys must be boys. No more marching,no more rural picnics, no more listeningto the Declaration and to orations thatmake their hearts burn within them withlove of country. If anybody marches itis the police, the firemen or a show regiment of the national militia. Fires arefrequent, and people are shot dead bystray bullets fingers, feet and eyes areblown away. Country people \"floiJfc tothe cities, instead of having celebrationsof their own. Next day after, all whosurvive gather themselves up and thankheaven the day is over for another year.Once more, let us resurrect the oldfaAicmad xuxtk Fenrtteof\"-VProlonjftaff Lift.When an Englishman writes a paperfor a British review, he consumes thefirst half of his space getting ready fprwhat he is going to say in the last half.This is what Mr. Robson Boose has donein The Fortnightly Review. After making his preparations, however, Mr. Roosesettles down to business and gives ussome useful hints about how to grow oldcomfortably, if not gracefully.He says there is no doubt but the average duration of human life is capable ofvery great extension. It is steadilygrowing longer. In England and Walesat the end of 1887 there were alive 400,000 persons who would have been deadif the average mortality had been asgreat from 1881 to 1887 as between 1871and 1881.Some of Mr. Roose\\'a directions for living long and keeping well have a slighttendency to make a man a slave to hisown health. A little judicious recklessness will often do as much as anythingilse to keep one strong and cheery. But,rammed up, the best part of the writer\\'sadvice is: Eat lightly of simple, naturalfood. If one feels tight at the belt afterdining he has eaten too much. Take adaily bath with water at a comfortabletemperature, followed by thorough rubbing with flesh gloves or brush.Take exercise in the open air and sunshine. Walking is good light gardening is excellent. Indulge very sparinglyin alcoholic drinks. Have some rationalhobby to amuse leisure hours—whist, orchids, amateur photography, or something like that. Finally, keep merry andcheerful, and keep at work. One neednot let himself down to-be old for manyyears.More\\'s the Pity.Very merry some witty editorial writers have been making themselves overthe lofty sentiments expressed in thecollege commencements. Lips withdown cm them have launched forth fearful thunders against political corruption,bossism and the use of money and themachine in politics. So they have! Andthe pity of it is that the world jeers atthem and laughs them out of these noblesentiments after they leave the peacefulcollege walls. If they would only stickto the heroic virtue they cherished as anideal during their school years, theseboys would in one generation reformour corrupt political methods, bribery,bossism and alL There never was a reform made real in the world except bythose who brought into actual life theideals that beckoned them on in theirgenerous, enthusiastic youth. «lt wasSchiller who said: \"Be true to the dreamof thy youth.\" It is because men arenot thus true that the world is corraptand faithless, and jeers at public virtueand purity.The Cronin Murder.It will be?t blow at Irish interests andIrish\\'secret societies from which theywill not soon recover, should members ofthe Clan-na-Gael, as such, be found implicated in the Cronin murder. Such anissue would be pounced upon and hailedas a godsend by all the Tories from oneend of Great Britain to the other. Theywould celebrate it to the utmost, as anoffset to the Parnell fiasco, as far as itwould go. They would expatiate on itas a fresh proof of the depravity of theIrish race, as fresh evidence that theyare incapable of self government. Oneof the Clan-na-Gael witnesses admittedthat the oaths and ritual of the ordermight be interpreted by an excitable,weak minded person to mean that hewould feel himself bound to commit amurder if ordered by his superior officersto do so. But it is sincerely to be wishedthat the organization will be cleared.The dam disaster of Johnstown hascaused consternation throughout thecivilized world. The people of Europeancountries are now troubled about thesafety of their dams. The matter is tobe brought up in the English parliamentLiverpool has prepared a tremendousHum at Llanwydda in North Wales,whence to draw her water supply. Thelake is four times the size of the Conemaugh reservoir, and if it burst itsbounds it would destroy several cities.It is confined by a solid wall ninety feetfViip.k, but even that is not quite sufficientto allay the fears of nervous Englishmenunder present circumstances. At Birmingham the reservoir is 210 feet abovethe town.The American Foreign Missionary society should send its preachers andteachers at once to labor among the nobility of Great Britain. If there aremore immoral, unblushing and unbelieving heathens on this globe than some ofthe high titled British noblemen theirwhereabouts has not been revealed up todate. The scandal just now attractingattention is the trial growing out of theaccusation by his high mightiness, LordDurham, that his high mightiness, SirGeorge Chetwynd, had been cheating athorse racing. In the code of morals ofthe sublime British nobility cheating athorse racing is rather worse than committing a murder.The Baltimore, the new cruiser builtat the Cramps\\' ship yard, Philadelphia,is 035 feet long, with a breadth of 48Jfeet, and 10} feet draught She is oneof the most powerful vessels in existence,the contract calling for a guaranteedengine force, under forced draught, of10,750 horse power. The Baltimore\\'srequisitions call for a speed of nineteenknots an hoar. She has a very heavysteel deck. So the American navy isgrowing.The supreme court of Wyoming haqdecided that where there is a tract ofgovernment land completely surroundedby private farms and lands, the privateowners have a perfect right to runfences around their own loads, eventhough the government tract is entirelyclosed thereby. The government has byffiia decision the same rights as a privateowner, no more and no less.

It is harmless in its effects but<br />powerfulAn relieve Pain. If you use it once you<br />will not likely be without it again. You will find it<br />a constant household friend, giving ease and relief<br />just when needed. Keep it constantly en band<br />and it will save you many hours of pain and suf<br />fering. There is hardly a pain it will not easj.—<br />There is hardly an accident that will occur where<br />it will not be useful.<br />Should one of your family get burned or scald<br />ed. cover the burned part with a cloth of several<br />thicknesses wet with the &quot;Master of Pain,&quot; and<br />keep the cloth saturated with it. In a short time<br />it will draw all the fire out. It will cause a prick<br />ling Sensation —this is the firo coming (Hit. Keep<br />it wet with the &quot;Master of Pain&quot; until the pain<br />and prict ling ceases. Let the wet cloth stay on<br />lor six or eight hours, after which apply some<br />healing ointment or sweet oil. In nearly all cases<br />of Pain or Soreness of the Chest, Throat, Side,<br />Back. Spine, Limbs or Joints, it will give relief.—<br />Kub it on freely with the hand or with a flannel<br />cloth until the skin becomes heated and burning.<br />For soreness of the throat tub it on until it pro<br />duces a little soreness.<br />For Croup use it in connection with the Cough<br />Syrup, by rubbing it on the chest.<br />For KheUmatism and all deep seated pains, if<br />the pair, is not speedily removed by rubbing with<br />the hand, lay a cloth wet with the liquid over toe<br />part aflected, and pass a warm smoothing iron over<br />it.<br />For Pains in tho Breast, Side or Back, the same<br />may be done.<br />For Tooth-ache, drop it on cotton, and apply it<br />to the uerve of the tooth, also rub the gums and<br />cheeks with it.<br />- For Frosted Feet, apply the &quot;Master of Pain&quot;<br />reely, and dry it in beiore the fire.<br />For li&gt;—J-ache rub it on the forehead.<br />It is culled &quot;Master of Pain.&quot; I did not give It<br />this name—l don&#39;t like the name. When I first<br />commenced making it it was without name or label.<br />I made it and sold it by tbe ouuee at my Drug<br />Store. 1 had no idea then of making a business<br />of it. Some who bought it called, it Master of<br />Pain, and by tbis name it became known for many<br />miles round. And finally, when I had a label<br />printed I was compelled to adopt the name, for by<br />that name it was known. After all, the name is<br />not so very inappropriate. It is used to alleviate<br />or remove pain. It is put ou wlicrevtr there is<br />pain. Sometimes it will cause pain, but the result<br />always is freedom irom pain.<br />Reader—try it—take a bottle with you—use it<br />whenever occasion requires- give it a f&#39;ir trial.<br />Prepared by W.

You will tiud it<br />a constant household frieud, giving ease and relief<br />just when needed. Keep it constantly on hand<br />and it will save you many hours of pain and suf<br />fering. There is hardly a pain it will not ease. —<br />There is hardly an accident that will occur where<br />it will not be useful.<br />Should one of your family get burned or scald<br />ed, cover the burned part with a cloth of several<br />thicknesses wet with the &quot;Master of Pain,&quot; and<br />keep the cloth saturated with it. In a short time<br />it will draw all the fire out. It will cause a prick<br />ling sensation—this is the fire coming out. Keep<br />it wet with the &quot;Master of Pain&quot; uutil the pain<br />and prickling ceases. Let the wet cloth stay on<br />lor sis or tight hours, after which apply some<br />healing ointment or sweet oil. In nearly all cases<br />of Pain or Soreness of the Chest, Throat, Side,<br />Back, Spine, Limbs or Joints, it will give relief.—<br />Rub it on freely with the hand or with a flannel<br />cloth until the skin becomes heated and burning.<br />For soreness of the throat rub it on until it pro<br />duces a little soreness.<br />For Croup use it in connection with the Cough<br />Syrup, by rubbing it on the chest.<br />For Rheumatism and all deep seated pains, if<br />the pain is not speedily removed by rubbing with<br />the hand, lay a cloth wet with the liquid over the<br />part aftected, aDd pass a warm smoothing iron over<br />it.<br />For Pains in the Breast, Side or Back, the same<br />may be done.<br />For Tooth-ache, drop it on cotton, and apply it<br />to the nerve of the touth, also rub the gums and<br />cheeks with it.<br />For Frosted Feet, apply the &quot;Master cf Pain&quot;<br />recly, and dry it in before the fire.<br />For Head ache rub it on the forehead.<br />It is called &quot;Master of Pain.&quot; I did not give It<br />this name—l don&#39;t like the name. When I first<br />commenced making it it was without name or label.<br />I made it and sold it by the ounce at my Drug<br />Store. 1 had no idea then of making u business<br />of it. Some who bought it called it Master of<br />Pain, and by this name it became known l&#39;or many<br />miles round. And finally, when I had a label<br />printed I wss compelled to adopt the name, for by<br />that name it was known. After all, the name is<br />not so very inappropriate. It is used to alleviate<br />or remove pain. It is put on wherever there is<br />pain. Sometimes it will cause pain, but the result<br />always is freedom from pain.<br />Reader—try it—take a bottle with yon—use it<br />whenever occasion requires- give it a fair trial.<br />Prepared by W.

R. found its way to my store,<br />opened the box and found it to contain your Balsa<br />mic Cough Syrnp. I had never heard of it at that<br />time but a Mr. Aughinbaugh from your state hap<br />pened to be present and said it was me of the best<br />cough remedies in use and happening to need a<br />cangh medicine in my family I determined to give<br />it a trial, and so well pleased was I with its effects<br />that 1 gave bottles of it to my friends all of whom<br />agree with me in pronouncing it the best cough<br />remedy they have ever met with. We have used it<br />for Coughs, Colds, Croup and Whooping Congh,<br />and in every case it gave the most signal relief.—<br />Yours truly,<br />ADAM FERGUSON.<br />I used in my family some of the Cough Syrup<br />refered to by Mr. Ferguson, and fully concur in<br />the opiniou expressed by him.<br />WM.

In a short time<br />it will draw all the fire out. It will cause a prick<br />ling sensation—this is the fire coming out. Keep<br />it wet with the &quot;Master of Pain&quot; until the pain<br />and prickling ceases. Let the wet cloth stay on<br />for sis or eight hours, after which apply some<br />healing ointment or sweet oil. Iu nearly all cases<br />of Pain or Soreness of the Chest, Throat, Side,<br />Back.

And finally, when I had a label<br />printed I was compelled to adopt the name, for by<br />that name it was known. After all, the name is<br />I not so very inappropriate.

Adm&#39;r.<br />bbbfoed m<br />MASTER OF PAIN.<br />THE GREAT EXTERNAL REMEDY,<br />For Sprains and Bruistt, Burns and Scalds,<br />Rheumatic and Neuralgic Pains, Swel<br />lings, Stiff Joints, Paralysis, or<br />Jtumbness of the Limbs, Pains<br />in the Breast, Side or Back ;<br />Throat, Tooth-Ache,<br />Frosted Feet, Sec., Sfc.,<br />And for the Relief<br />of Pain Anywhere<br />and Everywhere,<br />This is a most perfect preparation, and seldom<br />fails to dogood. It is harmless in its effeets but<br />powerful&#39;to relieve Pain. If you use it once you<br />will not likely be without it again. Yon will find it<br />a constant household friend, giving ease and relief<br />just when needed. Keep it constantly on hand<br />and it will save you many hours of pain and suf<br />fering. There is hardly a pain it will not eass.—<br />There is hsTdly an accident that will occur where<br />it will not be useful.<br />Should one of your family get burned or scald<br />ed, cover the burned part with a cloth of several<br />thicknesses wet with the &quot;Master of Pain,&quot; and<br />keep the cloth saturated with it. In a short time<br />it will draw all the fire out. It will cause a prick<br />ling sensation—this is the fire coming out. Keep<br />it wet with the &quot;Master of Pain&quot; until the pain<br />and prickling ceases. Let the wet cloth stay on<br />lor six or tight boars, after which apply some<br />healing ointment or sweet oil. In nearly all cases<br />of Pain or Soreness of the Chest, Throat, Side,<br />Back, Spine, Limbs or Joints, it will give relief.—<br />Hub it on freely with the hand or with a flannel<br />cloth until the skin becomes heated and burning.<br />For soreness of the throat rub it on until it pro<br />duces a little soreness.<br />For Croup use it in connection with the Cough<br />Syrup, by rubbing it on the chest.<br />For Rheumatism and all deep seated pains, if<br />the pain is not speedily removed by rubbing with<br />the hand, lay a cloth wet with the liquid over too<br />part aftected, and pass a warm smoothing iron over<br />it.<br />For Pains in the Breast, Side or Back, the same<br />may be done.<br />For Tootb-acbe, drop it on cotton, and apply it<br />to the nerve of the tooth, also rub the gums and<br />cheeks with it.<br />For Frosted Feet, apply the &lt;&#39;Master cf Pain&quot;<br />reely, and dry it in before the Are.<br />For Head ache rub it on the forehead.<br />It is called &quot;Master of Pain.&quot; I did not give it<br />this name—l don&#39;t like the name. When I first<br />commenced making it it was without name or label.<br />I made it and sold it by the ounce at my Drug<br />Store. 1 had no idea then of makiug a business<br />of it. Some who bought it called it Master of<br />Pain, and by this name it became known for many<br />miles round. And finally, when I bad a label<br />printed I was compelled to adopt the name, for by<br />tbat name it was known. After all, the name is<br />not so very inappropriate. It is used to alleviate<br />or remove pain. It is put on wherever there is<br />pain. Someti-nes it will cause pain, but the result<br />always is freedom from pain.<br />Reader—try it—take a bottle with yon—use it<br />whenever occasion requires- give it a fair trial.<br />Prepared by IV.
